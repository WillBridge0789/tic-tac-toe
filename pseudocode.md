# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Objectives
* The game should let the players know who's turn it is.
* Player x or player O
* Remove EventListeners
* Game tiles should only be clickable once
* if the game is over they should not be clickable at all.
* The game should display who wins the game if someone wins, otherwise, say that the game resulted in a tie.
* There should be a Restart Game button that does not refresh the page (set state).
* On each playerâ€™s turn, that player places one of their symbols on an unoccupied space by clicking.
* The game continues until one player places three symbols in a straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) and wins or there are no remaining available spaces and it is a draw.
* Only have a single <div id="app"></div> in your index.HTML (try to code golf the HTML file)
